TODO:

Improve thread safety
Improve buffering (so no stuter)
Improve startup time. The longest wait should be to pool the station first, no other delays.

Make sure buffering works, test with throttle or packet loss
Queue:
	add maxque length + max buffer length
	change how play head moves based on above
	Add ability to seek
 Make sure ALL POSSIBLE stream errors/problems are properly handled (ie: stream restart or death)

Add misc stream info to queue (diconnects, buffers, etc)

Hande station ID.
